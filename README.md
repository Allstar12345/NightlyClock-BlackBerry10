# NightlyClock-BlackBerry10


Nightly Clock is a bedside Application for the BlackBerry 10 platform.

My first Application for BlackBerry 10 was a huge learning curve and a fun project to work on.


Please note the code here is very old and was never cleaned up in time for the closure of BlackBerry World to developers.
